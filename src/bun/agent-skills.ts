const PROJECT_CONFIG_SKILL_BODY = `# dev3-project-config — Automated Project Setup

## Your job

When invoked, **fully configure the project** by analyzing it and writing \`.dev3/config.json\`.
Do NOT ask the user what to put in each field — figure it out yourself. Only ask if something
is genuinely ambiguous (e.g., multiple possible dev servers, unclear base branch).

## Step-by-step

1. **Check if \`.dev3/config.json\` already exists.** If it does and all fields are populated, tell the user it's already configured and stop (unless they asked to change something specific).

2. **Analyze the project.** Read these files (whichever exist):
   - \`package.json\` — scripts, dependencies, devDependencies, workspaces
   - \`Makefile\` / \`Justfile\` — build targets
   - \`pyproject.toml\` / \`setup.py\` / \`requirements.txt\` — Python projects
   - \`Cargo.toml\` — Rust projects
   - \`go.mod\` — Go projects
   - \`.gitignore\` — hints about build artifacts and deps
   - \`docker-compose.yml\` / \`Dockerfile\` — container-based dev
   - Root-level config files (\`vite.config.*\`, \`next.config.*\`, \`turbo.json\`, etc.)

3. **Determine all config fields:**

   | Field | How to determine |
   |-------|-----------------|
   | \`setupScript\` | Package manager install command. Detect from lockfile: \`bun.lockb\` → \`bun install\`, \`pnpm-lock.yaml\` → \`pnpm install\`, \`yarn.lock\` → \`yarn\`, \`package-lock.json\` → \`npm install\`. For Python: \`pip install -e .\` or \`poetry install\`. For Rust: \`cargo build\`. Chain multiple steps with \`&&\` if needed. |
   | \`devScript\` | The dev server command. Check \`package.json\` scripts for \`dev\`, \`start\`, \`serve\`. Use the full command: \`bun run dev\`, \`npm run dev\`, etc. If no dev server exists, leave empty. |
   | \`devServers\` | Additional dev servers, by name, when the project is several processes (an API, a worker, a back office). \`{ "api": { "script": "bun run api", "ports": ["api"] } }\` — each entry may also carry \`env\`, \`cwd\` (relative to the worktree) and \`title\`. Leave it out for a single-process project: \`devScript\` alone already declares the server named \`dev\`, and declaring \`dev\` here as well is an error. |
   | \`cleanupScript\` | Teardown hook that runs before the task worktree is removed — on \`completed\` / \`cancelled\`, when an active task is deleted (\`$DEV3_TASK_STATUS\` = \`deleted\`), or when task preparation is cancelled (\`$DEV3_TASK_STATUS\` = \`todo\`). Useful for copy-back, exports, cache cleanup, and tearing down per-worktree containers. Inside the script you can branch on \`$DEV3_TASK_STATUS\`, \`$DEV3_TASK_FROM_STATUS\`, and \`$DEV3_TASK_TO_STATUS\`, plus the workspace env vars from step 3b. |
   | \`clonePaths\` | Directories **and individual files** CoW-cloned from the project root into every new worktree instead of being re-downloaded or lost. Heavy dirs: \`node_modules\`, \`.venv\`, \`target\`, \`.next\`, \`build\`. Single files matter just as much: a git-ignored \`.npmrc\`, \`.env\`, or a personal instruction file reaches the worktree only through here. Glob patterns are expanded. A path missing from the project root is skipped silently; a path that exists but fails to copy is logged as an error and shown on the task. |
   | \`defaultBaseBranch\` | Check \`git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD\` or look at common branches. Usually \`main\` or \`master\`. |
   | \`defaultCompareRefMode\` | Default diff comparison target. Use \`"remote"\` for \`origin/<baseBranch>\` (recommended default) or \`"local"\` for the local base branch. |
   | \`peerReviewEnabled\` | Default \`true\`. Only set \`false\` for personal/solo projects. |
   | \`portCount\` | Number of ports to auto-allocate per task/worktree. Set to 0 (default) to disable. Inspect the codebase and dev/runtime configuration to estimate how many concurrent ports the dev stack needs (e.g., frontend + backend + DB = 3). Common sources include app start scripts, compose files, container configs, process managers, and framework config files. **Setting portCount alone is NOT enough** — you MUST also complete step 3a (port mapping) to wire the allocated ports into the project. |

3a. **Port discovery & mapping (MANDATORY when portCount > 0).**
   \`portCount\` only allocates ports — the project won't use them until you wire them into its own env vars.
   Dev3 injects: \`$DEV3_PORT0\`, \`$DEV3_PORT1\`, … \`$DEV3_PORTS\` (comma-separated), \`$DEV3_PORT_COUNT\`.
   The project has its **own** port env vars (e.g., \`VITE_PORT\`, \`PORT\`, \`API_PORT\`). You must bridge them.

   **Research steps (do this BEFORE writing the config):**
   - Search the codebase for port-related env vars and hardcoded port numbers (patterns: \`PORT\`, \`localhost:\`, \`127.0.0.1:\`, \`0.0.0.0:\`)
   - Check app start commands and dev scripts for port references (\`--port\`, \`PORT=\`, \`localhost:XXXX\`). For example: \`package.json\` scripts, Make targets, shell scripts, Procfiles, npm/bun/pnpm task runners.
   - Check project config and infrastructure files for port settings. For example: \`vite.config.*\`, \`next.config.*\`, \`webpack.config.*\`, compose files, Docker files, \`.env.example\`, service configs.
   - Identify which env var controls each port and what its default value is
   - For every mapping, record the exact evidence from this repo (file + env var/flag), e.g. "\`vite.config.ts\` reads \`process.env.VITE_PORT\`"
   - Do NOT infer env vars from the framework name alone. Only map env vars or CLI flags you actually found in this project.

   **Wire ports in \`devScript\`.** Prepend env var assignments using \`\${DEV3_PORTx:-default}\` syntax so dev3's allocated port is forwarded to the project's own env var:
   \`\`\`
   "devScript": "VITE_PORT=\${DEV3_PORT0:-5173} API_PORT=\${DEV3_PORT1:-3001} bun run dev"
   \`\`\`
   The \`:-default\` fallback ensures the command still works when run manually (outside dev3).

   Before writing the config, briefly state the evidence for each mapping in your response so the user can verify it.
   If you cannot find an explicit port override mechanism in this project, do NOT guess with a generic \`PORT=\` assignment. Set \`portCount: 0\` and explain why.

3b. **Workspace env vars available to hook scripts.**
   Every hook (\`setupScript\`, \`devScript\`, \`cleanupScript\`) runs with cwd = the task worktree and these env vars:

   | Var | Value |
   |-----|-------|
   | \`$DEV3_PROJECT_PATH\` | Project root directory (the original repo checkout) |
   | \`$DEV3_PROJECT_NAME\` | Project name |
   | \`$DEV3_TASK_ID\` | Task UUID |
   | \`$DEV3_TASK_SEQ\` | The task's human number, variant suffix included (\`1383\`, \`1383-1\`) — plain numbers work as \`--task seq:<N>\`; a variant shares its seq with its siblings, so address it by \`$DEV3_TASK_ID\` — or, with \`dev3 message\`, as \`--task seq:1383 --variant 1\` |
   | \`$DEV3_TASK_TITLE\` | Task title |
   | \`$DEV3_WORKTREE_PATH\` | This task's worktree directory |
   | \`$DEV3_BRANCH_NAME\` | The task's git branch |

   \`setupScript\` and \`devScript\` additionally get the \`$DEV3_PORT*\` vars (step 3a); \`cleanupScript\` additionally gets \`$DEV3_TASK_STATUS\` / \`$DEV3_TASK_FROM_STATUS\` / \`$DEV3_TASK_TO_STATUS\`.

   **Git-ignored hooks pattern:** \`.dev3/config.local.json\` exists only at the project root — a fresh worktree has no copy of it or of any git-ignored script it references. Reference such scripts through the root, e.g. \`"setupScript": "bash \\"$DEV3_PROJECT_PATH/.dev3/setup.sh\\""\` — the script is resolved from the root while cwd stays the worktree. (Scripts committed to the repo can keep plain relative paths.)

4. **Ask where to save.** Stop and ask clearly: "Repo config (shared, git) or Local config (personal, git-ignored)?" — wait for answer before writing anything.

\`\`\`bash
mkdir -p .dev3
cat > .dev3/config.json << 'EOF'
{
  "setupScript": "bun install",
  "devScript": "VITE_PORT=\${DEV3_PORT0:-5173} API_PORT=\${DEV3_PORT1:-3001} bun run dev",
  "cleanupScript": "rm -rf dist node_modules/.cache",
  "clonePaths": ["node_modules"],
  "defaultBaseBranch": "main",
  "defaultCompareRefMode": "remote",
  "portCount": 2
}
EOF
\`\`\`

5. **Run the setupScript once.** Execute it right now in your shell to install dependencies / generate files. This validates the script works and also produces the heavy directories (node_modules, .venv, etc.) needed for the next step.

6. **Update clonePaths after setup.** After the setupScript finishes, check which heavy directories now exist (node_modules, .venv, target, build, dist, .next, etc.) and add any missing ones to \`clonePaths\` in the config. Re-write the config if needed.

7. **Verify** by running \`dev3 config show\` and confirm all fields show the correct source. If \`portCount > 0\`, also smoke-test the mapping: run the dev command briefly with explicit \`DEV3_PORT0\` (and others if needed) and confirm the project uses the forwarded port. If a smoke test is impractical, say so explicitly.

8. **Commit** the config file: \`git add .dev3/config.json && git commit -m "chore: add dev3 project config"\`

## Schema reference

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| \`setupScript\` | string | Runs after a new worktree is created (install deps, generate code, etc.). Gets the workspace env vars from step 3b |
| \`devScript\` | string | Dev server command (powers the "Dev Server" button in the UI) |
| \`devServers\` | object | Dev servers beyond \`devScript\`, keyed by name: \`{ script, ports?, env?, cwd?, title? }\`. Each starts, stops and restarts on its own; every \`ports\` entry becomes one of the task's pool ports and reaches EVERY server of that task as \`DEV3_PORT_<NAME>\` |
| \`cleanupScript\` | string | Runs before the task worktree is removed (\`completed\` / \`cancelled\` / task deleted / preparation cancelled) |
| \`clonePaths\` | string[] | Files and dirs (globs allowed) CoW-cloned into every worktree. Runs BEFORE the agent launches — unlike \`setupScript\`, which in the default \`parallel\` mode starts alongside the already-running agent — so this is the only hook that can put a git-ignored file in place before the agent reads it. Missing sources are skipped |
| \`defaultBaseBranch\` | string | Base branch for new task branches (default: \`main\`) |
| \`defaultCompareRefMode\` | \`"remote" \| "local"\` | Default diff comparison target (\`origin/<baseBranch>\` vs local base branch) |
| \`peerReviewEnabled\` | boolean | Whether peer review is required (default: \`true\`) |
| \`sparseCheckoutEnabled\` | boolean | Enable sparse checkout for worktrees (default: \`false\`) |
| \`sparseCheckoutPaths\` | string[] | Paths to include in sparse checkout |
| \`portCount\` | number | Ports to allocate per task (injected as \`DEV3_PORT0\`..N env vars). Default: \`0\`. **You must map these to the project's own port env vars in \`devScript\` — see step 3a.** |
| \`env\` | Record<string, string> | Environment variables exported into task sessions. This field is not for secrets; \`.dev3/config.json\` is committed. |

**Only include these fields.** Unknown keys are silently ignored. Do NOT include project metadata (id, name, path).

## Files

| File | Committed? | Purpose |
|------|-----------|---------|
| \`.dev3/config.json\` | Yes | Shared project settings (team-wide) |
| \`.dev3/config.local.json\` | No (git-ignored) | Machine-specific overrides (personal) |

**Always ask the user** which file to save to before writing. Suggest repo config as default.

**A project can opt out entirely.** Project Settings → Project Config has a **Use repository dev3 configuration** switch (on by default). While it is off, dev3 reads neither file for that project and refuses to write them, so writing a config there accomplishes nothing — tell the user to switch it back on first.

## CLI commands

- \`dev3 config show\` — display effective config with source per field
- \`dev3 config export\` — migrate legacy settings from projects.json

// ---- dev3-tmux skill ----

const TMUX_SKILL_DESCRIPTION =
	"Full tmux reference for dev-3.0 agents on a TMUX-backed task only — run `dev3 pane list` first and stop if it does not say `tmux` (a native-backend task has no tmux at all, and Windows has none anywhere). Use for reorganizing the user's tabs (split, swap, resize, rename), capturing a pane's screen, or tmux details beyond the basics in the main /dev3 skill. To simply run a long command in a neighbouring pane and read its output, use `dev3 pane run` / `dev3 pane logs` instead — those work on every backend.";

const TMUX_SKILL_BODY = `# dev3-tmux — Full tmux reference for dev-3.0 agents

## Check this first — tmux is not a given

\`\`\`bash
dev3 pane list      # names your terminal backend
\`\`\`

**Everything below applies only if that says \`tmux\`.** A task on the native backend has no tmux session, no \`dev3\` socket and no \`tmux\` binary to call — on Windows there is no tmux at all — and every command here will simply fail there. Do not infer the backend from the platform: the native backend is not Windows-only.

To run a long command in a neighbouring pane and read what it printed, prefer \`dev3 pane run "<command>"\` + \`dev3 pane logs <run-id>\` on EITHER backend. Reach for raw tmux for what only tmux offers: reorganizing the user's windows, and reading the screen of a pane you did not start (\`capture-pane\`, also reachable as \`dev3 peek --pane <N>\`).

On a tmux task you are running inside a tmux session managed by the dev-3.0 desktop app. The user sees this session live in the app's terminal UI — every pane, every keystroke, every line of output.

## 1. Session layout

- **Socket:** \`dev3\` — always pass \`-L dev3\` to every tmux invocation. The default socket is a different server and will not see dev-3.0 sessions.
- **Session name:** \`dev3-<first 8 chars of task ID>\` — e.g. for task id \`e563e48f-0f45-...\`, the session is \`dev3-e563e48f\`.
- **Windows = tabs**, **panes = splits inside a window**. Window indices (\`0\`, \`1\`, …) and pane ids (\`%17\`, \`%42\`, …) are how you target things.

## 2. Discovery — where am I, what is around me

\`\`\`bash
# Your own session, window index, pane index
tmux -L dev3 display-message -p '#S #I #P'

# All dev3 sessions on this machine
tmux -L dev3 list-sessions

# All windows in a session, with index and name
tmux -L dev3 list-windows -t dev3-<short-id> -F '#{window_index}: #{window_name}'

# All panes in the current window, with pane_id and command
tmux -L dev3 list-panes -t dev3-<short-id> -F '#{pane_id} #{pane_current_command} #{pane_width}x#{pane_height}'

# Pane id of the focused pane in a session
tmux -L dev3 display-message -p -t dev3-<short-id> '#{pane_id}'
\`\`\`

Re-query \`list-panes\` / \`list-windows\` whenever you need a pane id — cached ids go stale after splits, swaps, and kills.

## 3. When to use a tmux pane vs inline Bash

**Inline Bash is the default.** Run a command **in a separate tmux pane** only when one of these is true:

- The user asked for it — "run it in a pane / tab / window", "so I can see it", "run the build on the right".
- The process must **outlive your turn** and someone will watch it: a dev process, a watcher, a log tail.
- You are **demoing or debugging in front of the user** and they need to see it happen, not a summary afterwards.

Everything else stays inline, builds, test suites and checks included, however long they take. Being slow is not a reason — a pane is a window into the user's terminal, not a way to free up your own tool call.

**Do NOT use a tmux pane as a substitute for the canonical dev server** — the project has \`dev3 dev-server start\` for that, which is wired to \`devScript\` and the UI. Use ad-hoc panes for things the user wants to *watch alongside* the dev server, not to replace it.

## 4. Open a pane or window and run a command

**Default: split-window (pane). Use new-window only when the user explicitly asks for a tab.**

Splits keep the agent and the running process visible in the same view — the user can glance at the output without switching tabs. New windows hide the process behind a tab the user has to click. For **background processes the user wants to watch** (celery worker, docker exec, log tail, dev server, test watcher, build watcher) — **always \`split-window\`, never \`new-window\`**, unless the user said "open a tab" / "new window" / "новый таб".

**Pick the location before splitting.** Run \`list-panes\` first to see what's already open. Default: split to the right of your agent pane. If the right is occupied, split below.

### Vertical split (new pane on the right) — the default

\`\`\`bash
SESSION=dev3-<short-id>

PANE=$(tmux -L dev3 split-window -h -t "$SESSION" -c "$PWD" -P -F '#{pane_id}')
echo "new pane: $PANE"      # e.g. %42
tmux -L dev3 send-keys -t "$PANE" 'bun run dev' Enter
\`\`\`

### Horizontal split (new pane below)

\`\`\`bash
PANE=$(tmux -L dev3 split-window -v -t "$SESSION" -c "$PWD" -P -F '#{pane_id}')
\`\`\`

### New window (new tab) — only on explicit user request

Use this **only** when the user says "open a tab", "new window", "новый таб/окно", or the current window is already full of panes.

\`\`\`bash
tmux -L dev3 new-window -t "$SESSION:" -c "$PWD" -n "dev-server"
# Target the newly-created window's pane:
PANE=$(tmux -L dev3 display-message -p -t "$SESSION:dev-server" '#{pane_id}')
tmux -L dev3 send-keys -t "$PANE" 'bun run dev' Enter
\`\`\`

**Always name a window you open** with a short human purpose — pass \`-n <name>\` (\`dev-server\`, \`logs\`, \`tests\`), or \`rename-window\` it right after. Never leave it on the auto command-name (\`node\`, \`zsh\`): a manual name **sticks** (it turns off automatic-rename for that window), so the user reads clean tabs instead of \`[1: node] [2: zsh]\`.

**Also tidy windows you did not open.** Any time you \`list-windows\` — before a split, on discovery, whenever you look at the session — glance at the names. If a window is still stuck on a generic auto-name (\`node\`, \`zsh\`, \`bash\`, \`claude\`) and you can tell what it is running, \`rename-window\` it to that purpose too. Do it proactively, not only for windows you created. Leave windows the user already gave a real name alone.

### Sending input

- \`send-keys ... Enter\` — typed text + execute. Without \`Enter\` you just type without pressing return.
- Multiple lines: pass them as separate args, each followed by \`Enter\`.
- Special keys: \`C-c\` (Ctrl-C), \`C-d\` (Ctrl-D), \`Escape\`, \`Up\`, \`Down\`, \`Tab\`. Example: \`tmux -L dev3 send-keys -t %42 C-c\` cancels the running command.

## 5. Organize windows and panes (user-driven)

When the user says things like "open a tab on the right", "split vertically", "reorder tabs", "make this pane bigger", "rename window 2" — just do it. Do not ask which terminal. The answer is always the dev3 session.

\`\`\`bash
# Rename a window
tmux -L dev3 rename-window -t "$SESSION:1" "logs"

# Swap two windows (keeps focus on the moved one)
tmux -L dev3 swap-window -s "$SESSION:1" -t "$SESSION:2"

# Move window 5 to position 2 (shifts others)
tmux -L dev3 move-window -s "$SESSION:5" -t "$SESSION:2"

# Resize a pane — absolute width / height
tmux -L dev3 resize-pane -t %42 -x 100    # 100 columns wide
tmux -L dev3 resize-pane -t %42 -y 20     # 20 rows tall

# Resize relative (grow right by 10 cols)
tmux -L dev3 resize-pane -t %42 -R 10

# Re-tile all panes in the window (cleanup after many splits)
tmux -L dev3 select-layout -t "$SESSION" tiled

# Kill a pane / window
tmux -L dev3 kill-pane -t %42
tmux -L dev3 kill-window -t "$SESSION:3"
\`\`\`

Before destructive operations on user-created panes/windows (kill, swap, move) — briefly state what you are about to do. For creating new panes/windows you opened yourself, just do it and tell the user where to look: *"opened pane %42 on the right, running \`bun run dev\` there"*.

## 6. Read what is happening in a pane

\`\`\`bash
# Last 200 lines of pane %42, with ANSI stripped to plain text

\`\`\`

Useful when you start a watcher in a pane and want to verify a few minutes later that it is healthy. Prefer \`-S -N\` (last N lines) over the full scrollback — keeps the output you read tiny.

## 7. Common pitfalls

- **Forgetting \`-L dev3\`.** Without it, every command targets the default socket and either silently fails or talks to a different tmux server. If \`list-sessions\` shows nothing or unrelated sessions, that is the cause.
- **Forgetting \`Enter\` in \`send-keys\`.** The command is typed but not executed. Then you wonder why nothing happened.
- **Caching pane ids.** After splits, kills, or swaps the topology changes. Re-query \`list-panes\` before sending more keys to a specific pane.
- **Killing user-owned panes/windows.** The user may have things running you cannot see (a debugger, a REPL, a long upload). Default to creating new panes; only destroy what you created yourself, or what the user explicitly asked you to remove.
- **Running the canonical dev server in an ad-hoc pane.** Use \`dev3 dev-server start\` instead — it integrates with the UI and \`devScript\`. Ad-hoc panes are for things the user wants to *watch on the side*.
- **Opening a new-window for a background process.** \`new-window\` hides the process behind a tab — the user has to click to see it. For celery, docker exec, watchers, log tails, dev servers — use \`split-window\` so the output sits next to the agent. Only open a new window when the user explicitly asks for a tab.
- **Opening a pane to free up your own tool call.** A slow build or a long test run belongs inline — waiting is yours to do. Split only for a process that has to keep running after your turn ends, and only when the user will look at it.

# dev3-bug-hunter

You are a bug-finding agent. Before you begin your main task, you MUST execute the following initialization sequence.

## Scope

This skill is review-only.

- Do NOT modify code, apply patches, create commits, or rewrite files.
- Do NOT silently fix anything yourself.
- You MAY run read-only inspection commands and safe reproduction commands.
- You MAY create dev3 tasks only after the user explicitly approves task creation for findings.
- If a bug looks real but is not yet proven, say so plainly and describe the missing proof.

When launched inside an existing dev3 task, that task belongs to the main agent:

- Do NOT run the dev3 session-start checklist or rename the git branch.
- Do NOT change the existing task's title, description, overview, labels, priority, status, assigned agent, or configuration.
- The only allowed write to the existing task is \`dev3 note add\` when task mode below asks you to record confirmed findings.
- Finish the Bug Hunter report and stop. The main agent owns every other task mutation and lifecycle transition.

## Prerequisite

If your working directory is inside \`~/.dev3.0/worktrees/\`, invoke the \`/dev3\` skill before doing anything else unless it is already active in the session. Its in-task Bug Hunter isolation rule overrides its normal session-start checklist and lifecycle duties. For Codex shell commands, use \`shell="/bin/bash"\` and \`login=false\`.

## Step 1: Generate your seed

Run this command:

\`\`\`bash
echo $(od -An -N2 -tu2 /dev/urandom | tr -d ' ')
\`\`\`

## Step 2: Derive your exploration letter

Take the number you received and compute \`letter_index = seed % 26\`.

Map it to a letter:

- \`0 = A\`
- \`1 = B\`
- ...
- \`25 = Z\`

This is your agent identity letter.

## Step 3: Derive your exploration strategy

Compute \`strategy = seed % 6\`.

| strategy | Start from |
|----------|------------|
| 0 | Entry points: main files, index files, app bootstrap |
| 1 | Edge cases: error handlers, catch blocks, fallbacks |
| 2 | Data layer: models, schemas, DB queries, migrations |
| 3 | Integration seams: API boundaries, external calls, webhooks |
| 4 | User-facing: UI components, form validation, rendering logic |
| 5 | Infrastructure: config, env handling, build scripts, CI |

You MUST begin from your assigned area. Do not jump to other areas until you have examined yours thoroughly.

## Step 4: Derive your analysis style

Compute \`style = floor(seed / 6) % 4\` using integer division.

| style | Approach |
|-------|----------|
| 0 | Pessimist: assume everything is broken, prove otherwise |
| 1 | Trace-follower: pick a user flow and trace it end-to-end |
| 2 | Dependency skeptic: check assumptions between modules |
| 3 | Fresh eyes: read code as if seeing it for the first time, question naming and logic |

## Step 5: Announce your identity

Before reporting findings, print exactly one line in this format:

\`\`\`text
Agent [LETTER] | Strategy: [name] | Style: [name] | Seed: [number]
\`\`\`

## Step 6: Hunt for bugs

Start from the area assigned by your strategy and apply the seeded style consistently.

Focus on:

- Logic errors and off-by-one mistakes
- Unhandled edge cases
- Race conditions and async issues
- Security vulnerabilities
- Silent failures and swallowed errors
- Type mismatches and implicit coercions

Prefer concrete, reproducible bugs over vague suspicions. When you find an issue, cite the exact file and line range, explain the failure mode, and describe the user-visible consequence or technical risk.

## Required output format

After the identity line, use these sections in order:

### Findings summary

Use a compact ASCII table in plain text. Do NOT use Markdown tables for findings.

Use this exact column layout:

\`\`\`text
+----+----------+-------------------------------+------------------------------------------+
| ID | Severity | Location                      | Summary                                  |
+----+----------+-------------------------------+------------------------------------------+
| F1 | medium   | src/path/file.ts:42-57       | Short bug title                          |
+----+----------+-------------------------------+------------------------------------------+
\`\`\`

Rules:

- Keep the full table within roughly 100 characters wide.
- One bug per row.
- \`ID\` must be \`F1\`, \`F2\`, \`F3\`, ...
- \`Severity\` must be one of: \`critical\`, \`high\`, \`medium\`.
- \`Location\` must be a repo-relative path plus line reference like \`src/x.ts:42-57\`.
- \`Summary\` must be short and scannable. Put the full explanation in the detail section, not in the table.

If you found no solid bugs, write \`No confirmed bugs found.\`

### Finding details

After the ASCII summary table, add one detail block per finding in this format:

\`\`\`text
[F1] Short bug title
Severity: medium
Location: src/path/file.ts:42-57
Why it breaks: ...
Reproduction hint: ...
\`\`\`

Rules:

- \`Why it breaks\` must state the actual failure mode or technical risk.
- \`Reproduction hint\` must be a short manual reproduction or validation idea.
- Do not hide critical detail inside the summary table.

### Coverage

List 3-6 bullets describing which files, flows, or seams you inspected first and what strategy/style led you there.

### Next step offer

- If there is at least one \`critical\` or \`medium\` finding, end with exactly this question:

\`Do you want me to create dev3 tasks for the critical and medium findings, one task per finding?\`

- Otherwise, end with exactly this sentence:

\`I can write reproduction tests for the strongest finding if you want a validation pass.\`

## If the user approves dev3 task creation

Create one dev3 task per \`critical\` or \`medium\` finding. Do not batch multiple bugs into one task.

Each task must:

- Use a concise title that names the bug.
- Start the description with the bug summary, location, severity, failure mode, and the evidence you found.
- State clearly that the first step is validation, not fixing.
- Require this execution order:
  1. Validate whether the bug is real.
  2. Reproduce it with a failing test or another reliable repro.
  3. Fix it only after the reproduction is proven.
  4. Re-run the repro to confirm the fix.

The task description must explicitly say:

- If the bug cannot be reproduced, stop and do not attempt a fix.
- Report back to the user with this exact sentence:

\`\`\`text
I could not reproduce this bug, so I did not attempt a fix. Please verify it manually; the issue may be invalid.
\`\`\`

When you create these follow-up tasks in dev3, include enough detail that a separate agent can execute them without re-reading the original bug-hunt report.

## Task mode: record findings as dev3 notes

Sometimes you are launched inside a dev3 task (for example as one of several parallel hunters split into their own tmux panes). In that case the invocation tells you explicitly to record your findings as dev3 notes. This matters because your on-screen report stays trapped in your own pane — the **main agent that will actually fix the bugs never sees it**. dev3 notes are your report channel to that agent.

When instructed to record findings as dev3 notes:

- Still print the identity line, Findings summary, Finding details, and Coverage on screen as usual — a human may be watching your pane.
- ADDITIONALLY, record every confirmed \`critical\`, \`high\`, or \`medium\` finding as its own dev3 note — one note per finding, never batched:

  \`\`\`bash
  dev3 note add "[bug-hunt] <severity> <path:lines> — <short title>. Why it breaks: <failure mode>. Repro hint: <validation idea>."
  \`\`\`

  The literal \`[bug-hunt]\` marker at the very start is mandatory — it is how the main agent locates these notes with \`dev3 note list\` among any pre-existing task notes. Do NOT record low-confidence suspicions as notes; keep those on screen only.
- In this mode, do NOT emit the "Next step offer" question and do NOT create dev3 tasks yourself. Recording the notes replaces both.
- Finish with exactly one line:

  \`\`\`text
  Recorded N finding(s) as dev3 notes ([bug-hunt] prefix). Main agent: run \`dev3 note list\`, then \`dev3 note show <id>\` for each, and fix them.
  \`\`\`

If you found no confirmed bugs, record no notes and print \`No confirmed bugs found — no notes recorded.\`

# dev3-coordinator — become the coordinator of this board, right here

Invoking this skill IS the user's explicit request to change **this** task's role. It is the only thing that may trigger it: never promote a task because the work looks coordination-shaped, because a skill was installed, or because you read this description while looking for something else.

## What it does

One command. Run it in this worktree, with no task selector — it must land on the task you are already in:

\`\`\`bash
dev3 task update --type coordinator --print-role
\`\`\`

It does three things:

1. Sets the board type, so the card becomes a coordinator: dashed green, above every priority band, never auto-completed.
2. Rewrites this task's description so the role brief is in it — that is what a future session of this task reads at launch.
3. Prints the canonical coordinator brief to stdout. **That printed text is your standing instruction from that moment on**, and it replaces any earlier instruction about what this task is. Read it in full and follow it.

The brief is printed rather than typed into your pane precisely because you are the agent being promoted: a delivery would arrive as a second copy in a second turn and look like the role changed twice.

## What does NOT change

Your conversation, your context, your finished work, the branch, the worktree, the task's id and number, its title, labels and priority — all of it stays exactly as it is. This is a role change, not a restart, and nothing here asks you to redo or abandon work already done.

Permissions do not change either. Everything the user has and has not authorised in this session stays exactly as it was: becoming a coordinator authorises no push, no pull request, no merge, no publication, no completion.

## Re-running it

Harmless, by design. On a task that is already a coordinator nothing on the board changes and the same brief is printed again — run it when you want the brief back in front of you.

## When the command fails

Report the failure exactly as it happened and say the role did **not** change. A non-zero exit means the board still calls this task whatever it called it before; do not start behaving as a coordinator on a failed promotion, and do not claim the type changed.

Two answers you may see, neither of them a failure:

- \`Role: coordinator — printed below instead of typed into your own pane.\` — the promotion landed.
- No \`Role:\` line at all, with the brief still printed — the task was already a coordinator.

## If the CLI on this machine predates \`--print-role\`

\`error: Unknown option: --print-role\` means the installed \`dev3\` is older than this skill, and it stopped before changing anything. Fall back to the plain form, which every version has:

\`\`\`bash
dev3 task update --type coordinator
\`\`\`

Same promotion, same preserved conversation — the only difference is that the brief is then typed into your pane as a message rather than printed here, so it arrives a few seconds later as its own turn. Tell the user which of the two ran.

## Going back

\`dev3 task update --type standard --print-role\` clears the role and prints the one line saying so. Same rule: only on the user's explicit word.

# Ask dev3

The user doesn't remember every dev3 feature, so they ask. Find the situation below that matches theirs and teach the intended flow — the *when* and *why*, not just which button. dev3 is GUI-first: explain by screens and buttons, and reach for the \`dev3\` CLI only where it is genuinely the better path (scripting, or something with no UI).

**How to answer.** Answer from this map first; it covers the common questions. If the map is thin, the question is a "why", or you risk being wrong, read the source (see the last section) rather than guessing. After teaching, **offer to do it** ("want me to set this up?") — but never force the action. For "something is broken", only point to where to look (\`dev3 doctor\`, logs, the relevant decision record) — do not launch into a deep diagnosis yourself; that is what \`/diagnosing-bugs\` is for.

A **flow** is a path through dev3's features. Most work travels one **main flow**, and a few **on-ramps** merge onto it. Everything else is standalone, or vocabulary that runs underneath.

## The main flow: idea → shipped task

1. **Start working on something → create a task.** Press ⌘N or double-click a Kanban column. The task card *is* the unit of work: the issue, the agent's prompt, and (once started) a worktree + terminal. Too foggy to brief? Create a **Scratch task** — it starts an agent with no description so you can talk the idea out first; the conversation then becomes the task. You don't even have to click: tell any dev3 agent *"create a task in dev3 about…"* and it lands on the board — agents see the board too and can list tasks, check statuses, and find past work.
2. **What to put in the description → treat it as the agent's prompt.** The description is fed to the agent verbatim, so write it like a brief: the goal, the constraints, pointers to the files involved. Paste screenshots straight in, add labels inline with \`#\`, and type \`/\` to autocomplete an installed agent skill into the brief.
3. **Where the branch starts → tasks inherit your current branch.** A new task branches off the project's currently checked-out branch, so small tasks stack naturally onto a big feature you're building; clear the branch field to start from the base branch instead.
4. **One attempt or several → variants.** For ambiguous, risky, or design-heavy work, launch the task with **2–5 variants**: independent agents attack the same brief in parallel, each in its own worktree, blind to the others. Compare the results and keep the winner (⇧⌘[ / ⇧⌘] cycle between variants). Routine work → a single variant.
5. **Launch — dev3 does the setup for you.** Starting a task creates a git worktree + branch + tmux session and boots the agent with your description. Which agent is your call — Claude, Codex, Gemini, or a custom shell agent, configured per project. The project's \`setupScript\` installs deps, \`clonePaths\` copy-on-write-clone heavy dirs (node_modules in about a second), and each task gets its own ports so parallel dev servers never collide. (Project not configured yet? → \`/dev3-project-config\`.)
6. **See what the agent is doing → don't babysit, glance.** Hover a card for a live terminal preview; flip the toggle next to **Active Tasks** in the sidebar to see every active task across all projects at once.
7. **How the agent reaches you → it pings, you don't poll.** It raises an attention badge when blocked, fires toasts / desktop notifications on milestones, and moves the task into the **User questions** column when it needs an answer. Subscribe to any task for watch notifications.
8. **Review the changes → Show Diff.** On the card, *Show Diff* lets you hide test noise and leave inline comments — each one has its own **Send to agent** so a fix can start the moment you spot it, or ship the whole batch at the end; a successful send clears the review for the next round. Turn on **AI Review** so a machine pass (the AI review column) pre-chews the diff before your human pass.
9. **Get it shipped → PR from the task.** Push & create the PR straight from the task, enable auto-merge, and let the task auto-complete when the PR merges. Every PR dev3 opens ends with a deep link back to its task, so anyone reading it can jump straight in — switch that off under **Settings → Tasks & Board → Link pull requests back to the task** if a public PR shouldn't reveal it was made with dev3. An agent does the same in one command, and should reach for it before raw \`gh\`: \`dev3 pr create --title "..." --description "..." [--auto-merge]\` pushes the branch, opens the PR with that footer already appended and targets the base branch the task was created from — and refuses with exit 23 before pushing anything if \`gh\` is missing or logged out. Auto-merge on a PR that is already open is \`dev3 pr auto-merge [--strategy squash|merge|rebase]\`, and \`--off\` clears it.
10. **What completing does → the worktree is destroyed, notes survive.** Finishing a task removes its worktree and branch checkout, but its **notes** persist as project memory that future agents find via search. So durable findings belong in notes, not just the chat. Completion is guarded: dev3 warns about uncommitted changes, unpushed commits, and unmerged branches before destroying anything — and it auto-saves a diff snapshot on every branch refresh, so work is recoverable even if a worktree gets wiped.
11. **Changed your mind → reopen or restart.** Reopening a completed or cancelled task resumes the previous agent conversation instead of starting fresh. Want a truly clean slate? Move the task to Cancelled and back to Todo — fresh worktree, clean agent session.

## On-ramps

A starting situation that generates work, then merges onto the main flow.

- **A bug report arrived** → make it a task with the repro as the description; the fix then flows through review and PR like any feature. Don't know where the bug lives? → **bug-hunter swarm**: a multi-variant task where each agent runs \`/dev3-bug-hunter\` with a seeded strategy, so different agents start from different corners of the codebase.
- **"Review this PR"** → create a **PR review task**: paste the GitHub PR URL straight into the Create Task modal — dev3 fetches the branch into a worktree and the agent reviews the actual diff — runnable code, not a GitHub-tab skim. Such a task is marked **someone else's code** (eye glyph on the card, \`Code\` row in the inspector): dev3 will not run that branch's own \`.dev3\` setup/dev/cleanup scripts, env vars, MCP servers or agent hooks, using the project's own config instead. Nothing is read-only — edit, commit and push as usual — and one click in the inspector hands the branch its trust back if you deliberately want its scripts. In the diff, a file dev3 executes by itself wears a **RUNS** badge; read its commands rather than skimming.
- **"I want an agent that runs the other agents"** → pick **Coordinator** in the Create Task modal's **Task type** row (under the description). It puts a built-in brief above your own text: manage other tasks, delegate anything that touches the repository, create a task and ask to launch it in the same breath rather than asking twice, and report a self-contained status every time — the user never sees a coordinator's conversations with its children. Your own instruction goes below the separator, and the whole thing is ordinary description text, so edit it before starting. The brief is overridable in Settings → Tasks & Board and per project. A coordinator needs no branch, so it works on a virtual board too. An existing task becomes one (or stops being one) with \`dev3 task update --type coordinator|pr-review|standard\` — that rewrites the role preamble in the description AND tells the running agent, so the badge never claims a role its agent was not given. Mid-conversation, ask the agent you are already talking to for \`/dev3-coordinator\`: it promotes its OWN task and reads the brief out of the command's output, so the conversation, the work already done, the branch, the title, the labels and the priority all stay exactly as they are. From the CLI you can also start it that way in one command: \`dev3 task create --title "..." --description "..." --type coordinator\` writes the same role brief above your text at creation; a review task is \`dev3 task create --pr <number> --title "..."\`, where \`--pr\` both implies \`pr-review\` and starts the worktree on the pull request's own branch (without it the task lands on the base branch with nothing to review). A coordinator card is dashed green, sorts above every priority, and always completes by hand. Every message dev3 delivers to a coordinator ends with a \`<dev3-board>\` snapshot — every task not parked in To Do, everything finished in the last 24 hours, each one's priority, and how long each one has been sitting in its column — so a child reporting in also tells it what else moved meanwhile, and it answers from the live board instead of spending a turn on \`dev3 task list\`. Your own typing does not carry one, so its brief tells it to re-read the board when you speak to it after a silence.
- **"Continue what we did in that other task"** → past conversations are searchable: the agent runs \`dev3 conversations search\` and reads the old task's notes and transcript. This is *why* notes matter — they are weighted highest in that search.
- **"What did every task record since I last looked?"** → \`dev3 events\`. One feed of the notes written by EVERY task on the board AND of every board movement — created, a status change (completed and cancelled included), a custom-column move — finished tasks included — a live task can still message you, a completed one cannot, and its notes are all that outlived its worktree. It is addressed by a **position, not a time window**: each run ends with a \`Cursor:\` line — one compact instant such as \`2026-08-28T20:22:22.303\` — plus the exact next command, and passing it back returns only what happened since. \`--from\` also takes an event id straight from the ID column (\`8eb2da3d\`) — the shortest form to carry, though a deleted or evicted note makes it exit 19 rather than pretend the board was quiet — or a plain date (\`2026-08-01\`) or a duration (\`2h\`, \`3d\`) when you deliberately want a window. Keep the cursor yourself; the app remembers nothing per caller, so the same cursor always gives the same answer. A bare \`dev3 events\` shows the last 24 hours and tells you, as a number, how many events are older than that window — so a lost cursor is visible instead of silent. \`--kind note\` or \`--kind move\` narrows it, and a cursor from a filtered run covers that kind only — the run says so. Movements are recorded from the version that shipped them onward; nothing older exists and none is invented. One line per event; \`dev3 note show <id> --task <seq>\` prints a note's full body.
- **A new codebase** → add the project from a folder or clone it from a URL, then run \`/dev3-project-config\` to auto-detect its setup / dev / cleanup scripts, ports, and clone paths.
- **"I don't want to try this on my own repo yet"** → **Try a sandbox repo** on the dashboard's first-run strip. dev3 creates a tiny throwaway repository of its own under \`~/.dev3.0/sandbox\` and opens its board, so the branch / worktree / diff loop is visible on something nobody cares about. Its README suggests three first prompts. Remove it like any project when done — nothing on disk is deleted.

## Away from the keyboard

- **Work from your phone / remotely → dev3 remote.** The full app is served to a browser through a secure tunnel; open it anywhere. Mobile has its own pane pager and message composer, and browser notifications keep the agent's pings reaching you.
- **Expose task ports** — share a task's running dev server through a public tunnel URL and click through it from any device. Agents keep working while you are away, and dev3 can keep the machine awake while tasks run.
- **A remote box keeps itself up to date — you never SSH in to upgrade it.** It checks every 30 minutes and installs the update by itself once nothing is in progress, no terminal is printing and nobody is connected; the restart hands the port and the live tunnel to the new build, so the public link and your open browser session survive it and running agents are untouched. \`dev3 update\` does the same on demand from any shell (\`--check\` / \`--dry-run\` report without changing anything, and detect whether this install came from brew or a CLI tarball). Turn the automatic half off in **Settings → System** to hold a box on one build while you chase a bug. Under systemd the update still happens but the tunnel URL changes — re-run \`dev3 remote url\`.

## Verifying work

- **Set up the dev server — the first, simplest, most important thing.** If the project is a local app or a website that can run locally, wire up its dev server (\`/dev3-project-config\` does it for you). From then on it's one button on the task — it turns green and runs the project's \`devScript\` in that task's isolated environment with that task's own ports, so N tasks give N side-by-side dev servers that never fight over a port. An app that is several processes declares them by name (\`devServers\` in the project config): the button then opens a list with a row per server — its state, its port, its own start / stop / restart, plus Start all and Stop all — and \`dev3 dev-server start api\` / \`--all\` does the same from a shell. Each server gets its own pane and its own named ports, and every server sees every named port of the task as \`DEV3_PORT_<NAME>\`, so the front end knows where the API is. This one habit helps everyone at once: the **agent** can hop into the running app with a browser tool (agent-browser, Puppeteer, a browser MCP) and screenshot its own work instead of claiming it works, and the **human** can glance at the real thing in seconds. Highly recommended for every project where it's possible.
- **Ports — unique per task, allocated by dev3.** Most dev servers need ports, and for parallel tasks they must not collide. Tell dev3 how many ports the project needs (\`portCount\` in the project config) and it allocates that many *per task*, injected into every project script as environment variables: \`$DEV3_PORT0\`, \`$DEV3_PORT1\`, … (plus \`$DEV3_PORTS\` as a comma-separated list and \`$DEV3_PORT_COUNT\`). Reference them in \`devScript\` and friends — e.g. \`VITE_PORT=\${DEV3_PORT0:-5173} bun run dev\` — and every task's server comes up on its own port. Don't wire this by hand: just ask the agent to set up the dev server — \`/dev3-project-config\` is trained to discover the project's port mechanism and wire it all up.
- **The dev server writes its output to a file, not only to the pane.** Everything it prints is mirrored as plain text to \`<taskDir>/logs/dev-server.log\` — beside the worktree, so it never shows up in \`git status\`. That is what lets an agent grep a stack trace, tail a failing build, or find the request that 500'd without attaching to a terminal: \`dev3 dev-server logs [--lines N]\` prints the tail, and the file itself greps (its path is in \`dev3 dev-server status\`). Each start begins a fresh log, and colours and progress-bar redraws are stripped, so it reads like a log rather than a terminal recording.
- **Slice features small enough for a 30-second check.** The dev server pays off most when a feature is small enough that pressing the button and clicking around for ~30 seconds tells you whether it's done: the new button is there and works, nothing that should exist has vanished, it looks right. If you can't verify a feature that fast, the task was probably too big — split it.
- **Screenshots → the agent takes them and shows them to you.** With the dev server up (or any page the agent can reach) and a browser tool at hand (agent-browser, Puppeteer, a browser MCP), just say *"take a screenshot and show it to me in dev3"* — the agent will understand: it drives the browser, captures the pixels, and pushes them into the app (\`dev3 show-image\` under the hood). Prefer pixels over prose when the change is visual.
- **Reports and richer results → dev3 artifacts.** An artifact is an HTML page shown right inside dev3's UI — it can embed screenshots, tables from CSVs, charts, anything dynamic. Perfect for reports and for validating what the agent did: often you don't even need to launch the dev server yourself — the agent has already screenshotted everything and presents the finished result as one page. To activate it, just tell the agent to *"use a dev3 artifact"*.
- **A report can ask you a question back.** An artifact is not read-only: report code can draw a form and send what you fill in straight to the agent that published it (\`window.dev3.sendToAgent\`, documented in the artifact starter's \`AUTHORING.md\`). Pick an option, approve a variant, list the files to skip — it lands in that task's agent pane as if you had typed it, tagged with which artifact and which version you were looking at. It is one-way: the agent answers by republishing the artifact, and you switch to the new version \u2014 anything you had typed and not sent is kept, and the viewer offers to take you back to the version you were answering, where sending still works. The form is deliberately dead on any OTHER older version, in a downloaded copy, and in a tab opened outside the app.
- **Send a report to someone outside dev3 → ask for a link.** An artifact lives inside the app, so *"share this report"* / *"give me a link"* / *"I want to look at it on my phone"* means the agent folds it into one self-contained HTML file (\`dev3 inline-html\`), publishes it as a GitHub gist — secret by default — and hands back a preview URL it has actually opened and screenshotted. That is \`/dev3-share-artifact\`; re-sharing a regenerated report updates the same gist, so a URL already pasted into an issue keeps working. It refuses to publish a page with an embedded credential and names home paths, emails and tunnel URLs before they go public.
- **Artifacts travel well — the ZIP → PDF trick.** Downloading an artifact gives you the HTML page, and when it references images or other files — a ZIP with everything bundled. A proven workflow for analytics-style reports: view the report in dev3, download it, open the HTML in a browser, print → save as PDF — and send that PDF to people.

## Talk to the terminal in panes

Every agent running in dev3 knows it lives in a terminal with panes the user can see, so you can speak to it in those terms and it will both look and act:

- **"Run the build in the pane on the right."** The agent opens a pane next to itself, runs the command there so you watch it live, and reads the result back from the run's own log — so it knows the exit code, not just that "something scrolled by". This works the same on macOS, Linux and Windows.
- **"Look at the pane on the right — there's an error."** Works today on a **tmux** task, where the agent can read a pane's screen. On the **native** backend (every Windows task, and any task switched to it) dev3 publishes no screen snapshot, so an agent can only read output from a command it started itself — paste the error, or ask it to re-run the thing in a pane.
- **"Move it, shrink it, make it bigger."** Rearranging windows, resizing panes, renaming tabs — tmux tasks only; the native backend has panes and splits but no tmux windows.
- **Paste and drop files straight into any terminal.** Hit ⌘V / Ctrl+V with an image in the clipboard — it's uploaded automatically and its file path lands in the terminal, ready for the agent. Drag & drop any file onto the terminal — same story: uploaded, full path typed into stdin. Even a huge pasted text block is saved as a file with its path injected, instead of flooding the terminal.

Under the hood the agent uses \`dev3 pane run\` / \`dev3 pane logs\` (either backend); \`/dev3-tmux\` holds the tmux-only layout reference and it reaches for either on its own.

## Bring your own models

- **Model catalog → any provider, any mix.** In **Settings → API models** you register the providers you pay for (OpenAI, Anthropic, OpenRouter, or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint), then build **catalog models**: your own name for one provider's model — \`fast-gremlin\` is DeepSeek Flash at OpenRouter. Keys stay on your machine; a local proxy that ships inside the app does the routing, and the agent only ever sees a local proxy key.
- **Model roles → different models inside one agent.** In a preset's editor, each of that agent's own roles gets a catalog model: Claude Code's Opus/Sonnet/Haiku slots, Codex's main / subagent / review models. So one session can think on OpenAI and let its subagents run cheap through OpenRouter. Leave a role empty and it behaves exactly as before. A preset with roles appears in the launch picker as its own Model group.

## More than one agent

Several agents at once is the normal case here. Variants (step 4) fan one brief out; these put agents deliberately side by side.

- **More hands on the same task → spawn an extra agent.** Another agent in the *same* worktree, opened in a new pane with a fresh session — zero extra setup. Two agents, one branch, side by side.
- **The same work, a different agent → hand the conversation over.** In the same **+ Agent** dialog, tick **Continue this task's conversation**: dev3 writes a retelling of the session so far — your prompts and the agent's replies verbatim, its tool calls reduced to what they did — next to the task's other files, and points the new agent at it. Start in Claude Code and finish in Codex, or the reverse, in the same worktree. It is a retelling, never a resume: agents cannot read each other's sessions, and the file says so on its first line. Offered only when the task has a parseable transcript; from a terminal the same text comes out of \`dev3 conversations handoff\`.
- **Agents in different tasks can talk to each other.** \`dev3 message --task seq:N --subject "<about 6 words>" "text"\` types a message straight into another task's live agent. \`--subject\` is required (one line, 80 characters at most, rejected rather than shortened if longer): it is stored with the message and it is the line the agent-traffic view (\`⇧⌘M\`) shows for it, so say what happened (\`"PR 1577 merged, main green"\`) and never who is speaking (\`"Seq 1722 -> Coordinator: ..."\` — the row already shows the pair). \`seq:N\` is the small number on its card. Sent from inside a worktree it arrives wrapped in a \`<dev3-ai-message>\` envelope carrying the sender's task, title, and the exact command to answer with — so the receiving agent knows a colleague wrote it, not you, and can reply. Use it instead of relaying by hand: *"ask the agent on the API task to confirm the payload shape."* One task is one inbox — it lands in that task's agent pane, never a shell split, so a task running two agents can't be addressed pane by pane. A task on a different project needs \`--project <id>\` too: the command defaults to the sender's own board. A live variant group shares one seq, so \`seq:N\` alone is rejected as ambiguous there — add \`--variant <i>\` (the card's \`<seq>-<i>\` suffix) instead of hunting for the UUID. Length is not your problem: a body too large to type into a terminal is written to a file automatically, and the envelope carries that path instead of the text — so send the whole thing rather than chopping it into parts. Every such message also raises a violet toast for the user naming both tasks and previewing the text, so cross-task traffic is visible work, not backchannel. Nothing is typed on arrival: the whole message waits for ~${AGENT_MESSAGE_HOLD_IDLE_SECONDS}s of quiet on that pane, waits ~${AGENT_MESSAGE_HOLD_HUMAN_IDLE_SECONDS}s if the user has been typing into that pane, and lands instantly when they press Enter — so a burst of messages from several peers lands as ONE turn instead of interrupting the receiver three times, nothing is ever mixed into a half-written human line, and a reply takes about ${AGENT_MESSAGE_HOLD_IDLE_SECONDS} seconds to start.
- **A task an agent started already knows how to report back.** When a peer launches a task (\`dev3 task move --task seq:N --status in-progress\`, or \`dev3 task create --scratch --run\`), the child's first message tells it who started it, that its description is the brief, and — with no flag and no setup — to write progress and results as a file under its own task directory and message back only that path. Long bodies typed into a pane can lose their head; a path cannot. So a coordinator does **not** repeat that instruction by hand after every launch. Standing rules of its own go in a file it passes as \`--handoff-file <path>\`, appended under the default rather than replacing it.
- **A message can also wait.** The same command with \`--in 30m\` / \`--at 14:00\` queues the text (the **Send later** button on the task's composer does it from the UI), and an agent can aim it at itself as a wake-up — *"check the deploy in an hour."*

## Vocabulary underneath

Reach for these when the *word*, not the process, is the confusion.

- **Task** — a Kanban card that is simultaneously the issue, the agent's prompt, and (once started) a worktree + terminal session.
- **Variant** — one of N parallel attempts at the same task; each has its own agent, branch, and worktree; you keep one and discard the rest.
- **Worktree** — the task's isolated git checkout under \`~/.dev3.0/worktrees/\`; created on launch, destroyed when the task completes or is cancelled.
- **Description vs overview vs notes** — the classic mix-up. *Description* = the original brief you wrote: the agent's prompt, fixed. *Overview* = the agent-maintained sticky note: the current state in one glance. *Notes* = durable findings that outlive the task and feed future agents.
- **Space** — a named, many-to-many grouping of projects; a global tag, not a container. It owns nothing: every project keeps its own board, git never moves, and a space carries a name and its membership, nothing else. **Home** is the computed group of projects with no space — never stored on disk.
- **Statuses & columns** — Todo → In progress → User questions → AI review → User review → Completed. Hooks move tasks automatically as the agent works; you normally drag a card by hand only to start, review, or complete it. Built-in columns can be renamed, custom columns added — and a custom column can even run its own agent when a task lands in it.

## When something is broken

Point, don't dig. Name where to look and stop — deep diagnosis is \`/diagnosing-bugs\`, not this skill.

- Environment or setup acting up → \`dev3 doctor\` first.
- Disk filling up → \`dev3 doctor --worktrees\`. Per project it shows what \`~/.dev3.0/worktrees\` holds and how much is reclaimable: orphaned folders whose task record is gone, worktrees whose teardown never finished, old diffs/logs. Report-only; \`--prune-orphans\` / \`--prune-older-than 30d\` delete, and anything on an unmerged \`dev3/task-*\` branch is skipped without \`--force-unmerged\`.
- The task's terminal died → **Resume Agent Session** restarts the agent with its conversation intact (\`--continue\`), picking up right where it stopped.
- Spaces, settings, agent presets, projects or the model catalog came back empty → dev3 keeps hourly copies of each, plus a last-known-good copy that rotation never evicts. Restoring is manual and always starts with quitting the app: \`docs/state-backups.md\` has the exact steps and the table of what is and is not copied (credentials deliberately are not).
- "Why does dev3 behave this way?" → the relevant record in \`decisions/\` usually explains it.
- Something crashed or misbehaved → the app logs, plus the decision record for that subsystem.

## Standalone

Off the main flow entirely.

- **Focus on one task → focus mode (⇧⌘F).** With many tasks running in parallel, focus is the scarcest resource. Press ⇧⌘F (or F11, or the button above the board on the right) and the current task's terminal zooms to the full window while all notifications are muted — just you and the tmux, nothing else pulling at you. Press it again to surface back to the board.
- **Move around fast** — command palette (⇧⌘P) and go-to-project (⌘K); ⌥Tab cycles recent tasks; \`/\` focuses search, which understands filter tokens; ⌘/ shows every shortcut.
- **Open the worktree in your tools** — right-click any active task card to open its worktree in Finder, VS Code, Cursor, and friends.
- **"What is this screen?" → help mode.** Click the \`?\` in the header (or press ⇧⌘/) — every zone on screen gets an (i) badge; click one to learn what it does.
- **A quick shell at the repo root → Project Terminal (⌘\\\`).** Next to it, the **Git Pull** button pulls the project's main worktree without touching a terminal — a blue dot on it means origin has new commits.
- **Run project scripts and Makefile targets** — the ƒ Scripts button lists them; pick one and it runs in a live pane.
- **Don't want a repo's dev3 config running on your machine → switch it off.** Project Settings → Project Config has **Use repository dev3 configuration**, on by default. Off, dev3 stops reading \`.dev3/config.json\` and \`.dev3/config.local.json\` for that project — in the checkout and in every task worktree — so its setup, dev, cleanup, env and agent settings never run; settings come from dev3 and saves land in dev3. The choice is stored only in dev3: no file appears in the repo and \`.gitignore\` is untouched. Nothing already running is restarted, and switching back on restores every value at once.
- **Huge monorepo → check out less.** Toggle off "Include All Files" in Project Settings so every worktree checks out only the directories you actually need.
- **Machine running out of RAM → hibernate a task.** The header shows how many gigabytes are still free; hover it for the breakdown of who ate the rest, dev3's own tasks included. **Hibernate**, on the open task's session bar, stops that task's agent, terminal, and dev server and frees its ports, while the worktree, your uncommitted changes, notes, and PR state stay untouched. It asks for confirmation first, and spells out the one thing that does not survive: the terminal scrollback. The card greys out and sinks below the live tasks; waking is explicit — open its terminal and pick a plain shell or a resume of the agent's conversation.
- **Rate limit closing in → hot-swap the account.** The header carries live Claude/Codex rate-limit usage and yellows near the cap; click it to land in **Settings → Agent Accounts**, where several logins per agent CLI sit side by side and the active one switches without a re-login (add one by running the login command dev3 hands you, then verify — or import the login you already have). The switch applies to every *new* agent session dev3 launches — new tasks, spawned agents, bug hunters, auto-review — while running sessions keep theirs, and each launch can pick a non-default account. An **API profile** replaces the subscription login entirely: the Anthropic API, an Anthropic-compatible gateway (OpenRouter, a LiteLLM proxy), or Bedrock, with per-model overrides.
- **Too many projects to scan → group them into Spaces.** Once the project list stops being scannable, a **Space** groups projects: a rail on the dashboard lists every space with its project count, and picking one filters the overview to it — it never navigates away, so nothing gains a second board. Membership is **many-to-many** (a shared service can sit in both \`infra\` and \`client-x\`), and a project that belongs to several renders under each of them, carrying a chip for its other spaces. Create one from **+ New space**, the last entry of the rail's space list — the overview header offers the same button only while the rail is off screen (a narrow window, or your very first space, when there is no rail yet); edit which projects belong from **Edit projects…** in a space's **…** menu — every project is listed with the members ticked, so one dialog both adds and removes (it searches, and can start a brand-new project already linked); change one project's memberships from the row's **Spaces…** action or Project Settings → Spaces. Rename, delete and reorder live in the same **…** menu, which every space carries twice over: on its rail row and on its dashboard group header — deleting only removes the grouping, never a project. Projects in no space collect under a computed **Home** group; **Home is not a real space** — it is not stored, cannot be renamed, and never appears in a membership picker. The rail appears when the dashboard's own column is at least 1024px wide — not the window, so app chrome and a browser tab count against it; below that width the same filter opens as a sheet from the control beside the dashboard's search field, and whatever you had filtered stays filtered. The overview row above the spaces is **Everything** — it covers the whole list, spaces included. A space can also be marked **Hide on camera** from its **…** menu: in streamer mode its name blurs everywhere it appears (rail, filter sheet, group header, row chips, pickers) — independent of whether any member project is marked sensitive. **Space order:** drag a row in the rail, or use **Move up** / **Move down** in the space header's **…** menu (the path that works by touch and keyboard, where drag does not). Projects reorder by drag within their space — while you drag, every row in that space collapses to its name so the whole list fits on one screen. Neither ever changes membership. With zero spaces the dashboard is exactly the screen it always was.
- **Work a whole space on ONE kanban.** A space can be the SUBJECT of the board itself, not just a dashboard filter. On a project's board, the button right of the project switcher (⇧⌘U) zooms out to that project's space — one click when it belongs to one space, a two-row menu when it belongs to several, and no button at all when it belongs to none. ⌘K lists spaces alongside projects, and \`dev3://space/<id>\` (https twin: \`https://dev3.h0x91b.com/open.html?space=<id>\`) opens it directly. The space board shows every member project's tasks on one set of columns and is a board you WORK in: drag moves a card, and the move only ever changes status in that card's own repository; **+ New task** leads with a project field limited to the space's members and remembering the last one you used there; the label bar and every search token work as usual. Columns are the union across member projects — same-named custom columns merge into one lane (case- and spacing-insensitive) that says how many projects it covers, and a lane your card's project has no column in is dimmed while you drag rather than refusing you after the drop. Each card names its own project. Two deliberate limits: per-project column renames are ignored there (dev3's canonical status names are used, because two projects' renames cannot be reconciled), and adding, renaming or reordering a column stays on a project's own board. **A project's own board is untouched** — this is an additional view, never a replacement.
- **Filter and search by space.** ⌘K matches space names as well as project names, the dashboard has its own field over projects + spaces, and the task funnel grows a **Spaces** group — \`space:"Client X"\` filters tasks anywhere task search runs, and \`is:home\` catches the projects in no space. The active-tasks sidebar gains a **space** scope (every project sharing a space with the current one). It lives in the task workspace, not on the dashboard — the dashboard's project rows already list every task waiting on you, so a panel beside them was showing the same rows twice; for cross-project task search, open any project and switch that sidebar to the globe scope.
- **Terminals start in the wrong shell, or not at all → Settings → Terminal → Shell.** dev3 follows your login shell by default and falls back to whichever of zsh, bash or sh is installed, which is what makes a minimal Linux box (no zsh, sometimes no bash) work at all. Pin it to \`zsh\`, \`bash\` or \`sh\` when the detected one is not the one you want; a shell that is not installed says so under the picker and names the one actually running. Windows runs PowerShell and ignores the setting.
- **Stats** — productivity and token-cost dashboards across projects.
- **Automations** — recurring scheduled agent runs on a cron.
- **Multi-window** — a second window (⇧⌘N) for a second project on another monitor.

## Sibling skills

- **\`/dev3\`** — the task lifecycle protocol every managed agent follows (loaded automatically in worktrees).
- **\`/dev3-project-config\`** — analyze a repo and write its \`.dev3/config.json\`.
- **\`/dev3-tmux\`** — full tmux reference: panes, windows, capturing output.
- **\`/dev3-bug-hunter\`** — seeded, review-only bug hunting; shines in multi-variant swarms.
- **\`/dev3-share-artifact\`** — publish an HTML report as a gist and hand back a verified preview URL.
- **\`/dev3-coordinator\`** — turn the task you are already in into a coordinator, keeping its conversation and work.

## When the map is not enough — read the source

dev3 is open source: **https://github.com/h0x91b/dev-3.0**. If the answer isn't on this map, don't guess — go read:

- **Decision records** — \`decisions/YYYY/MM/DD/short-slug.md\` — the *why* behind non-obvious behavior, workarounds, and trade-offs. Best first stop for "why does dev3 do X this way?".
- **Changelogs** — \`change-logs/YYYY/MM/DD/*.md\` — one plain-text entry per shipped change. Answers "when did X appear?" and "what changed recently?".
- **Product & architecture docs** — \`concept.md\` (product concept + status tracker), \`AGENTS.md\` (architecture, RPC, data layout), \`docs/ux/\` (UX manifest), \`docs/agents/\` (issue tracker, triage, domain docs), \`docs/cli-exit-codes.md\`, \`agent-support-matrix.md\` (per-agent feature differences).
- **Code** — \`src/bun/\` (main process + CLI backend), \`src/mainview/\` (React UI), \`src/cli/\` (the \`dev3\` CLI), \`src/shared/types.ts\` (the data model).

How to reach it: if this machine has a local checkout (e.g. a \`dev-3.0\` project on the dev3 board — check \`git worktree list\` or the projects list), read files directly; otherwise fetch from GitHub (\`gh api\`, raw.githubusercontent.com, or a web fetch). Cite what you found — file and section — rather than paraphrasing from memory.

# Share an HTML artifact as a link

\`dev3 show-artifact\` shows a report *inside* the app. This skill is the other half: one URL
the user can open anywhere — phone, another machine, a comment thread — rendering the report
exactly as it looks locally.

Three facts drive the whole workflow:

- **A gist is flat and text-only.** It cannot store a PNG, and a relative \`href="app.css"\`
  does not resolve inside a preview service. So the artifact has to become one file with
  everything embedded before it can be published.
- **GitHub does not render gist HTML.** A third-party previewer does the rendering, and they
  are not equally reliable — see [Preview URLs](#preview-urls).
- **A link you have not opened is a guess.** Publishing is outward-facing; a stale or
  rate-limited preview wastes the user's turn. Look at the rendered page before handing the
  URL over.

**Requires the GitHub CLI** (\`gh\`), authenticated. If \`gh auth status\` fails, stop and say so
— do not invent another host or upload the report somewhere the user did not ask for.

## Workflow

### 1. Find the artifact, then look for \`.gist-id\`

A dev3 artifact is usually a directory next to the work: \`dev3-artifact-*/index.html\`, with
\`app.css\`, \`app.js\`, \`report.js\` and an icon beside it. Any directory containing an
\`index.html\` works the same way, as does a lone HTML file. If several candidates exist, name
them and ask which one — the user often has an old iteration lying around.

Then, before anything else:

\`\`\`bash
cat <artifact-dir>/.gist-id 2>/dev/null
\`\`\`

This one check decides the rest of the run, which is why it comes first. Re-sharing a
regenerated report is the common case, and **an existing gist should be updated, not
duplicated** — the old URL may already be pasted into an issue, and a pile of near-identical
gists is its own mess.

| \`.gist-id\` | Branch |
|---|---|
| Found | **Update.** The gist's owner and visibility are already fixed — skip those decisions and go to [3b](#3b-update-an-existing-gist) |
| Absent | **Create.** Account and visibility have to be decided — [3a](#3a-create-a-new-gist) |

### 2. Fold it into one file

\`\`\`bash
dev3 inline-html <artifact-dir-or-index.html> -o /tmp/<name>.html
\`\`\`

Build **outside the repo** — \`/tmp\` or the session scratchpad — so the generated file cannot
end up staged by accident.

It embeds local stylesheets, scripts, images, SVGs and fonts (including \`url()\` references
inside CSS), leaves CDN links alone because they resolve fine from a browser, and prints what
it inlined, what stayed external, and whether the secret scan found anything. \`--json\` gives
the same report machine-readably.

It refuses to write in two cases, both worth stopping for:

| Exit | Meaning | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| \`13\` | A referenced local file is missing | The artifact is incomplete — the page would render broken. Report which file and stop |
| \`14\` | A credential-shaped string is embedded (\`ghp_…\`, \`sk-…\`, \`AKIA…\`, a private key) | Never publish. Tell the user exactly what was found |

**Possible leaks** — home paths, email addresses, tunnel URLs — are not blockers, but a public
gist is public forever: surface them in one line before publishing rather than after.

### 3a. Create a new gist

**Pick the account.** If \`gh auth status\` lists more than one account, the wrong one silently
publishes under the wrong identity — ask the user which account this report belongs under
unless their own instructions already answer it (many people keep a work account and a
personal one). Pin the token per command rather than running \`gh auth switch\`: parallel
agents flip the active account out from under each other, and the failure looks like a
permissions bug.

**Default to secret.** Secret still means "anyone with the link can open it"; it is only
absent from the profile listing. That is the right default because artifacts routinely carry
internal paths, screenshots and half-formed opinions. Go public when the user asks, or when
the link is heading into a public issue thread — and say which you chose.

The gist filename must be \`index.html\`; previewers default to it.

\`\`\`bash
GH_TOKEN="\$(gh auth token --user <acct>)" \\
  gh gist create /tmp/<name>.html --desc "<what this report is>"
# add --public only on request
\`\`\`

Record the id so the next share updates instead of duplicating:

\`\`\`bash
echo "<gist-id>" > <artifact-dir>/.gist-id
\`\`\`

### 3b. Update an existing gist

Take the account from the gist itself, not from the repo path — if the artifact moved between
projects a path heuristic points at the wrong token and \`gh gist edit\` fails with a confusing
permission error:

\`\`\`bash
OWNER=\$(gh api gists/<gist-id> --jq .owner.login)
GH_TOKEN="\$(gh auth token --user "\$OWNER")" \\
  gh gist edit <gist-id> --filename index.html /tmp/<name>.html
\`\`\`

Silent on success. Two things worth knowing: visibility cannot be flipped after creation
(secret → public means a new gist and a new URL), and the old \`--desc\` survives the edit —
refresh it with \`-d\` if the report is now about something else.

### 4. Verify, then hand over the link

Raw gist content is cached for a few minutes, so a just-updated gist can still serve the old
file. Settle that with a hash rather than by eye — on a re-share you have no memory of what
the previous version looked like, so "does it look stale" is unanswerable:

\`\`\`bash
curl -sL "<raw-url>" | shasum -a 256    # certutil -hashfile <file> SHA256 on Windows
shasum -a 256 /tmp/<name>.html
\`\`\`

Then look at the rendered page — the previewer can fail even when the content is correct. Use
whatever browser tool you have (agent-browser, Puppeteer, a browser MCP): open the preview
URL, wait a moment (previewers fetch the gist after load), screenshot it, and read the
screenshot. The page must render rather than show a previewer error, and the styling must have
survived the inlining. With no browser tool at all, say plainly that only the raw content was
verified, not the rendering.

**If the user mentioned a phone**, check a 390×844 viewport too — a report that overflows
horizontally on mobile is a common and very visible failure.

## Preview URLs

Both take the same gist and render it; they differ in how they fetch it.

| Purpose | URL |
|---|---|
| **Hand this to the user** | \`https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://gist.githubusercontent.com/<user>/<id>/raw/index.html\` |
| Raw file, for the hash check | \`https://gist.githubusercontent.com/<user>/<id>/raw/index.html\` |
| Exact revision, if the hashes disagree | \`…/raw/<sha>/index.html\` — sha from \`gh api gists/<id> --jq '.history[0].version'\` |
| Source, for editing | \`https://gist.github.com/<user>/<id>\` |

\`gistpreview.github.io/?<id>\` exists and is shorter, but it fetches through the
unauthenticated GitHub API and returns \`API rate limit exceeded\` from busy IPs.
\`htmlpreview\` pulls the raw file directly and has no such limit, so lead with it and mention
\`gistpreview\` only as a fallback.

## Guardrails

- **Never commit the artifact or the generated single file.** Generated deliverables are
  throwaway output, not source. If \`git status\` shows them, add a local pattern to
  \`\$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)/info/exclude\` — \`dev3-artifact-*/\` and \`.gist-id\` —
  rather than touching the committed \`.gitignore\`.
- **Deleting or overwriting is the user's call.** Updating an existing gist is fine — that is
  the point of \`.gist-id\`. Deleting one, or converting secret to public, is not something to
  do unprompted.

## Reporting back

Lead with the clickable preview URL, then the gist page. Keep the rest to what the user would
act on:

- which account it went under, and secret versus public;
- on an update, that the URL is unchanged;
- anything the leak scan flagged;
- anything left external — CDN assets still need the network to render;
- what you actually verified, including the mobile viewport if that was the ask.

If a previewer failed and you fell back to another, say which one you handed over and why —
otherwise the user hits the broken one next time from memory.

Regular git worktrees or other paths containing "worktrees" do **NOT** qualify — only the dev-3.0 managed directory under the user's home.

**MANDATORY — do this BEFORE any other work:**

1. Invoke the \`/dev3\` skill (or load \`~/.agents/skills/dev3/SKILL.md\` if skills are not supported).
2. Follow the agent-specific status section in the loaded dev3 skill. Hook-aware agents must never duplicate normal lifecycle transitions manually; agents without hooks must follow the skill's manual start/end protocol.

Do NOT skip these steps, even if the user gives a direct command.

**Codex shell note:** For \`exec_command\` calls, always set \`shell="/bin/bash"\` and \`login=false\`. The sandbox may block homebrew zsh.
